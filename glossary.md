# Glossary

This glossary contains definitions of key terms used throughout the Reality-Codex and the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis.

---

**Boseâ€“Einstein Condensate (BEC)**  
A state of matter formed when a group of bosons is cooled to near absolute zero, causing them to occupy the same quantum state and behave as a single coherent entity.

**Consciousness**  
The subjective experience of awareness, perception, and thought. In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis (LIUH), consciousness is considered a fundamental component of reality rather than a byproduct of matter.

**Event Horizon**  
The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. In LIUH, it is sometimes discussed as a potential interface between our rendered reality and deeper substrate layers.

**Hilbert Rendering Zone (HRZ)**  
A conceptual interface where consciousness interacts with the informational substrate to collapse potential states into experienced reality.

**Informational Substrate**  
A foundational, coherent informational field underlying all of physical reality. In LIUH, this substrate encodes and governs the rules of our universe.

**Quasicrystal**  
A structure that is ordered but not periodic, often appearing in patterns that never repeat exactly. In LIUH, the quasicrystalline model is proposed as a possible blueprint for the substrate.

**Wavefunction Collapse**  
The process by which a quantum system's multiple potential states reduce to a single outcome upon observation or interaction. In LIUH, this is interpreted as a rendering event via the HRZ.
