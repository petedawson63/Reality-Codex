# Informational Collapse Hierarchy

The collapse hierarchy describes how high-coherence informational states progressively "step down" into lower-energy, more stable configurations, eventually producing classical matter and events.  

At each stage, information is refined and stabilized. This process links particle decay in physics (tau → muon → electron) to the recursive rendering steps in the HRZ-substrate interaction.
