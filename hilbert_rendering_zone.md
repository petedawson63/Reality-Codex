# Hilbert Rendering Zone (HRZ)

The Hilbert Rendering Zone is the interface layer between consciousness and the informational substrate. It is where probabilistic states collapse into rendered reality.

**Key points:**
- Acts as a dynamic boundary between potential and actualized states
- Works recursively and in feedback with the substrate
- May exist in nested hierarchies (local HRZs inside higher-order HRZs)

**Related concepts:** [Substrate](substrate.md), [Informational Collapse Hierarchy](informational_collapse_hierarchy.md)
