# Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles share a single quantum state, such that a change in one is instantly correlated with the others, regardless of distance.  

In the LIUH framework, entanglement reflects the substrate’s inherent coherence — the same informational structure is accessed by multiple HRZs simultaneously. This provides a mechanism for instantaneous consensus across observers and for maintaining a unified reality.
