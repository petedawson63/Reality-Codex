# Bose–Einstein Condensate (BEC)

## Summary
A Bose–Einstein condensate is a phase of matter where many bosons occupy the same quantum state so the system behaves like one giant wave. In mainstream physics BECs show extreme coherence at very low temperatures. In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis (LIUH) we treat BEC behavior as a working analogy and possible mechanism for **substrate-level coherence**. The idea is simple. If microscopic matter can enter a single shared state under the right constraints then an informational field could also maintain a unified phase that spans large domains. That coherence then supports stable rendering by the [Hilbert Rendering Zone](hilbert-rendering-zone.md).

## Standard science in brief
- **What it is**  A state of matter predicted by Einstein and Bose where a dilute gas of bosons is cooled near absolute zero so the de Broglie wavelengths overlap and a macroscopic quantum state forms.  
- **How it is made**  Laser cooling and evaporative cooling trap atoms like rubidium sodium or strontium then remove the hottest fraction until the cloud crosses the critical temperature and condenses into the ground state.  
- **How it behaves**  Exhibits long-range phase coherence interference fringes quantized vortices superfluid flow suppressed thermal fluctuations.  
- **Why it matters**  BECs are tabletop demonstrations of macroscopic quantum order used to probe superfluidity Josephson effects matter-wave optics atom interferometry and precision sensing.

## LIUH interpretation
**Claim**  LIUH proposes that the informational substrate can exhibit BEC-like coherence. Not literally a low-temperature atomic gas but **an informational condensate**  a phase where many admissible descriptions collapse into
