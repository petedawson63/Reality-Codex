# Quantum Entanglement — Standard Physics

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one instantly determines the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This connection occurs without any signal passing between them in space, which challenges classical ideas about locality and separability.

## 1. How It Works
In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in superposition, holding multiple possible states at once. When two particles interact in certain ways, their combined state becomes entangled. This means their properties are described by a single shared wavefunction. If you measure one particle, the outcome will be correlated with the outcome of a measurement on the other particle, even if they are separated by light-years.

## 2. Key Experiments
- Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) Paradox — In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen highlighted entanglement as a problem for quantum mechanics, calling it “spooky action at a distance”.
- Bell’s Theorem (1964) — John Bell derived inequalities showing that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics.
- Aspect Experiments (1980s) — Alain Aspect and colleagues performed experiments confirming violations of Bell’s inequalities, supporting the quantum view of entanglement.

## 3. Core Properties
- Nonlocal correlations — Measurement results are correlated beyond classical limits.
- Instantaneous state definition — Once one particle is measured, the correlated properties of the other are instantly defined.
- Basis dependence — The measurement results depend on the chosen measurement basis.
- Persistence — Entanglement can survive large distances and in some cases long durations.

## 4. Practical Uses
- Quantum cryptography — Secure communication using quantum key distribution (QKD).
- Quantum teleportation — Transfer of quantum states from one particle to another without moving the particle itself.
- Quantum computing — Entanglement is a key resource for parallelism and speedup.

## 5. Relevance to Our Hypothesis
In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis, entanglement is viewed as evidence that the underlying informational substrate is not bound by spacetime constraints. The correlations do not require a signal to travel; instead, they emerge from a shared informational state maintained in the substrate. From this perspective, distance is an illusion at the substrate level, and entangled systems are rendered as a single informational object within the Hilbert Rendering Zone (HRZ).

## 6. Extended Interpretation in LIUH
Entanglement in LIUH is not a fragile link but a natural property of coherent informational structures. Measurement is seen as a phase-alignment event between the observer’s HRZ and the shared informational state in the substrate. This removes the need for a superluminal explanation — the “instantaneity” is simply the HRZ accessing a single data record that exists outside conventional spacetime.
