# Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles share a single quantum state, meaning the measurement of one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon has been experimentally confirmed many times, challenging classical ideas about locality and realism.

In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis (LIUH), entanglement is not a mysterious “spooky action” but a natural feature of the informational substrate. In this view, the substrate maintains coherence across space and time, allowing Hilbert Rendering Zones (HRZs) to render correlated outcomes instantly without physical signals traveling between particles.

Standard physics treats entanglement as a quantum mechanical effect confined to isolated systems, often stripping away wider context. This reductionist approach makes entanglement appear as an isolated anomaly rather than part of a continuous rendering process.

## Role in LIUH

In LIUH, entanglement is evidence of the substrate’s global coherence. HRZs can access shared informational states in the substrate, ensuring that collapse events remain consistent for all observers. This also links directly to the Codex — the substrate’s ‘rule set’ — which ensures that rendered outcomes are consistent with the agreed laws of physics across all perspectives.

Entanglement is therefore a cornerstone of intersubjective consensus reality. Without it, observers in different locations might render conflicting events, breaking the illusion of a stable physical world.

## Experimental Parallels

- Bell test experiments have shown correlations faster than light could transmit.
- Satellite-based entanglement distribution has extended confirmed coherence over 1,200 km.
- Long-lived entanglement in macroscopic systems suggests the phenomenon scales beyond individual particles.

## Implications for Reality Rendering

Entanglement in LIUH points to:
- **Nonlocal information access** — HRZs connect to the same underlying state.
- **Coherence preservation** — substrate ordering prevents decoherence from breaking correlations.
- **Instantaneous rule enforcement** — Codex logic applies globally without delay.

These implications also extend into time offsets, where entanglement may preserve correlations across temporal as well as spatial separation.
