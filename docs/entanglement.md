# Quantum Entanglement — Standard Physics

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one instantly determines the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This connection occurs without any signal passing between them in space, which challenges classical ideas about locality and separability.

## 1. How It Works
In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in superposition, holding multiple possible states at once. When two particles interact in certain ways, their combined state becomes entangled. This means their properties are described by a single shared wavefunction. If you measure one particle, the outcome will be correlated with the outcome of a measurement on the other particle, even if they are separated by light-years.

## 2. Key Experiments
- Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) Paradox — In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen highlighted entanglement as a problem for quantum mechanics, calling it “spooky action at a distance”.
- Bell’s Theorem (1964) — John Bell derived inequalities showing that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics.
- Aspect Experiments (1980s) — Alain Aspect and colleagues performed experiments confirming violations of Bell’s inequalities, supporting the quantum view of entanglement.

## 3. Core Properties
- Nonlocal correlations — Measurement results are correlated beyond classical limits.
- Instantaneous state definition — Once one particle is measured, the correlated properties of the other are instantly defined.
- Basis dependence — The measurement results depend on the chosen measurement basis.
- Persistence — Entanglement can survive large distances and in some cases long durations.

## 4. Practical Uses
- Quantum cryptography — Secure communication using quantum key distribution (QKD).
- Quantum teleportation — Transfer of quantum states from one particle to another without moving the particle itself.
- Quantum computing — Entanglement is a key resource for parallelism and speedup.

## 5. Relevance to Our Hypothesis
In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis, entanglement is viewed as evidence that the underlying informational substrate is not bound by spacetime constraints. The correlations do not require a signal to travel; instead, they emerge from a shared informational state maintained in the substrate. From this perspective, distance is an illusion at the substrate level, and entangled systems are rendered as a single informational object within the Hilbert Rendering Zone (HRZ).

## 6. Extended Interpretation in LIUH
Entanglement in LIUH is not a fragile link but a natural property of coherent informational structures. Measurement is seen as a phase-alignment event between the observer’s HRZ and the shared informational state in the substrate. This removes the need for a superluminal explanation — the “instantaneity” is simply the HRZ accessing a single data record that exists outside conventional spacetime.

## 7. Reductionist vs Holistic Views

From a strict reductionist perspective, entanglement is treated as a peculiar quantum correlation that can be isolated and analysed mathematically. This viewpoint often abstracts entanglement from the wider system it emerges from, focusing only on the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. While effective for narrow calculations, this approach risks removing entanglement from its broader context, leading to interpretations that may seem counterintuitive or incomplete.

The holistic view, which aligns more closely with the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis, places entanglement within a larger framework of coherent system behaviour. Here, the phenomenon is seen as one manifestation of a deeper network of informational relationships. Rather than existing in isolation, each entangled pair is part of a web of connections that can span multiple scales — from subatomic particles to macroscopic systems and even biological networks.

## 8. Feedback Loops and Stability

In LIUH, entanglement is linked to recursive feedback loops between the Hilbert Rendering Zone and the substrate. These loops maintain the stability of correlations over time and distance. When the HRZ accesses an entangled state, the informational coherence is reinforced rather than degraded, provided no decoherence events occur. This allows entanglement to persist far longer than classical intuition
