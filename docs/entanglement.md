# Quantum Entanglement

## 1. Introduction

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that their states are linked, regardless of the spatial distance between them. A measurement performed on one particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, even if they are separated by light-years. This correlation persists even when the particles are no longer interacting in a conventional physical sense.

In the **Local Informational Universe Hypothesis (LIUH)**, entanglement is not a strange quirk of quantum mechanics but a natural consequence of all phenomena being rendered from a single coherent **informational substrate**. Entanglement in LIUH is the manifestation of multiple Hilbert Rendering Zones (HRZs) accessing the same coherent informational pattern.

## 2. Historical Background

The concept emerged from debates in the early development of quantum mechanics. In 1935, **Albert Einstein**, **Boris Podolsky**, and **Nathan Rosen** published the famous EPR paper, arguing that quantum mechanics must be incomplete if it allowed such “spooky action at a distance.” In response, **Niels Bohr** defended the Copenhagen interpretation, which accepted the phenomenon as a feature of reality.

For decades, entanglement remained a philosophical puzzle until **John Bell** formulated **Bell’s theorem** in 1964. Bell showed that if quantum mechanics was correct, entangled systems would violate certain inequalities that any local hidden-variable theory must obey. Experiments beginning in the 1970s and culminating in the 2010s have consistently confirmed violations of Bell inequalities, ruling out local hidden variables.

## 3. Physics of Entanglement

Two particles can become entangled through interactions that cause their quantum states to become inseparable. The resulting joint state cannot be factored into independent states for each particle.

For example, two spin-½ particles might be prepared in a **singlet state**:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( | \uparrow \downarrow \rangle - | \downarrow \uparrow \rangle )
$$

In this state, measuring the spin of one particle along a chosen axis immediately determines the outcome for the other — not because a signal travels between them, but because they share the same underlying wavefunction.

## 4. Properties

- **Nonlocal correlations** – measurement results are correlated regardless of separation.  
- **Monogamy of entanglement** – strong entanglement between two systems limits entanglement with others.  
- **Fragility** – entanglement can be lost through interaction with the environment (decoherence), although LIUH proposes a deeper mechanism for its persistence.  
- **Basis independence** – correlations can appear in different measurement bases.

## 5. The LIUH Interpretation

In the LIUH framework:  

1. **Shared substrate state** — Entangled particles are not sending signals to one another; rather, they are reading from and writing to the same coherent pattern in the informational substrate.  
2. **Nonlocality as geometry** — The concept of distance in spacetime is secondary to the substrate’s topology. Two events far apart in spacetime can be “adjacent” in informational space.  
3. **Decoherence as desynchronisation** — Loss of entanglement happens when HRZs lose phase alignment with the substrate’s shared pattern.

## 6. Cross-links with Other LIUH Topics

- **Bose–Einstein Condensate** – a macroscopic example of coherence that can sustain entanglement-like properties.  
- **Wave Function Collapse** – entanglement plays a key role in how collapse events are synchronised between observers.  
- **Informational Substrate** – provides the “storage medium” where entangled states persist.  
- **Informational Collapse Hierarchy** – describes how entanglement fits into nested layers of coherence.

## 7. Experimental Highlights

- **Aspect experiments (1980s)** – verified violation of Bell inequalities.  
- **Zeilinger’s photon entanglement** – extended tests to long distances and satellite links.  
- **Recent quantum teleportation** – light and matter states transmitted via entanglement over tens to hundreds of kilometres with coherence times exceeding 30 hours.

## 8. Mathematical Note

Bell inequalities for local hidden variables take the form:

$$
|S| \leq 2
$$

Quantum mechanics predicts, and experiments confirm:

$$
|S| \leq 2\sqrt{2}
$$

In LIUH, this stronger bound arises because entangled systems are rendered from a single informational blueprint rather than from independent local realities.

## 9. Astrophysical and Cosmological Implications

Entanglement might be a foundational property of the cosmos, linking widely separated regions. LIUH suggests that:  
- Early universe conditions may have imprinted universal-scale entanglement patterns.  
- Black hole event horizons could preserve entanglement through substrate-level coherence, offering a possible resolution to the black hole information paradox.  
- Cosmic microwave background anomalies might reveal traces of large-scale entanglement.

## 10. Experimental Implications for LIUH

- Measure entanglement lifetimes in highly coherent systems to test for substrate-level stability.  
- Search for entanglement signatures across cosmological distances.  
- Develop hybrid quantum systems (e.g., matter-light entanglement) to probe deeper coherence properties.

## 11. Conclusion

Entanglement is not merely a puzzling quirk of quantum mechanics — it is a window into the deep structure of reality. Within LIUH, entanglement arises naturally from the way all phenomena are rendered from a single coherent substrate, making it one of the clearest empirical hints that our universe operates as an interconnected informational whole.
