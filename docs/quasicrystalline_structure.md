# Quasicrystalline Structure

A quasicrystal is a highly ordered structure that never exactly repeats, unlike conventional crystals. In LIUH, the substrate may take a quasicrystalline form, providing infinite non-repetitive possibilities for rendering reality.  

Quasicrystals can encode complex patterns efficiently, potentially serving as the “informational scaffold” that supports the HRZ’s rendering process.
