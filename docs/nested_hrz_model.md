# Nested Hilbert Rendering Zones

A nested HRZ model proposes that reality is rendered in layers, with local HRZs (e.g., individual minds) operating within larger-scale HRZs (e.g., collective fields, planetary consciousness, or cosmic rendering layers).  

This nesting allows for different levels of consensus and reality stability, and explains why local variations (personal perception) can exist within a globally coherent reality.
