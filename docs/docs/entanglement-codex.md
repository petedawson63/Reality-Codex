# Entanglement and the Codex

In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis (LIUH), the Codex is the deep informational rule set embedded within the substrate. It governs how rendered outcomes must align across all observers and frames of reference.

Entanglement provides one of the clearest demonstrations of the Codex at work. When two particles are entangled, their measurement outcomes always follow precise correlations, even when separated by vast distances. In LIUH terms, this is because both particles are not communicating through space but are instead accessing the same Codex entry — the same informational state stored in the substrate.

## Why Standard Physics Struggles

Standard quantum mechanics acknowledges that correlations occur but stops short of describing *how* they are enforced. Reductionist approaches treat entanglement as a disconnected effect, without placing it in the broader framework of reality’s coherence. This leaves open questions about why correlations remain perfect, even when decoherence should disrupt them.

## Codex Enforcement Mechanism

In LIUH, every entangled system has a Codex-linked identity — an informational ‘anchor’ that ensures any collapse event matches the Codex rules instantly and globally. There is no need for physical signals between particles because both are resolved directly from the same substrate state.

## Implications

- **Global rule enforcement**: The Codex ensures all HRZs render the same outcome for a given entangled system.  
- **Stability across frames**: The same rules apply whether observers are stationary or moving at relativistic speeds.  
- **Potential temporal reach**: Codex-linked entanglement could extend correlations across time as well as space.

This perspective transforms entanglement from a strange anomaly into direct evidence of a global, ordered substrate that maintains reality’s coherence.
