# Informational Substrate

The informational substrate is the foundational layer beneath physical reality, composed of structured, coherent information rather than particles or waves. In the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis, it is modeled as a quasicrystalline or Bose-Einstein condensate-like field, holding all possible states in superposition until rendered.  

This substrate provides the "code base" for reality. Consciousness accesses it through the HRZ, selectively drawing from potential to create the experienced moment.
