# Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)

A Bose-Einstein condensate is a state of matter where particles occupy the same quantum state, behaving as a single coherent entity. In LIUH, the substrate may exhibit BEC-like properties, allowing large-scale coherence necessary for stable rendering.  

Laboratory BECs demonstrate many of the properties hypothesized for the substrate, such as phase alignment, low-entropy order, and sensitivity to external influence.
