# Reality-Codex
An interactive Q&A reality knowledge base.
Reality-Codex

An interactive Q&A reality knowledge base that compiles every detail from the Local Informational Universe Hypothesis and related research. This repository is designed to be a living “Codex” — a reference for exploring how reality might unfold, based on physics, consciousness studies, and speculative models.

Purpose

The Reality-Codex brings together:

All rules, principles, and mechanisms described in the LIUH framework.

Definitions of scientific and technical terms.

Links between concepts, ancient philosophies, and modern theories.

A structured knowledge base you can query and explore.

How to Use

1. Browse the /docs folder for topic breakdowns.


2. Search this repository using keywords (e.g., Hilbert Rendering Zone, quasicrystal, substrate).


3. Open the rules.md file for the master list of “laws” and relationships in the model.


4. Use the glossary in glossary.md to quickly look up technical terms.
